# Salome_Design

Repository Description: Chemical Engineering Components Design and Mesh in Salome

This repository hosts a collection of chemical engineering components designed and meshed using Salome, an open-source platform for CAD modeling and mesh generation. The repository is dedicated to providing high-quality, reusable 3D models and finite element meshes for chemical engineering applications, such as reactors, heat exchangers, distillation columns, and piping systems. Each component is meticulously designed to reflect real-world chemical engineering geometries and is meshed for use in computational simulations, including fluid dynamics (CFD), heat transfer, and structural analysis.

Key Features:

Component Library: Includes a variety of chemical engineering equipment, such as pressure vessels, mixers, and separation units, modeled with precise geometries.
Salome Workflows: Detailed scripts and tutorials for creating, editing, and meshing components in Salome, ensuring reproducibility and ease of use.
Mesh Configurations: Pre-generated meshes (structured and unstructured) optimized for solvers like OpenFOAM, ANSYS, or COMSOL, with documentation on mesh quality and refinement.
Open-Source: All models and meshes are freely available under an open-source license, encouraging collaboration and customization.
